Rhythms & Code: A Harmony of Tech & Interests

#intro
Hi, I'm Soheil Salimi, a multifaceted developer with a passion for crafting seamless app experiences. Currently balancing university life with my devotion to coding, I've been enchanted by the world of tech since I was 15. When not immersed in TypeScript, Rust, or Vue, you can find me vibing to lofi tunes or escaping into fantasy literature.

With over 6 years of hands-on experience in building and deploying apps, I've refined my skills in:

    Front-end mastery with Vue
    Back-end prowess with Rust or Node
    Elegance and functionality with TypeScript
    And all the essentials for a holistic app development experience

Whether it's a personal project or a collaborative effort, I'm dedicated to fusing technical excellence with creative flair, always aiming to surpass expectations.
